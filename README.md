### Description

This is an experimental 32 Bit Assembler. Originally planned for me to learn assembly language it turned out way bigger then I thought. It supports most of the standard, FPU, MMX, SSE and 3DNow instructions,

can write Windows executables, has WinAPI support, can assemble SIB expressions (for example [eax*2+ebx-10]) and of course has labels. There are 2 examples in the zip file: An editor for writing Windows Executables and an example of assembling source code at runtime to directly call it (a touch of inline assembler).

//Update: The examples had German comments and there was a small bug in the console example.
